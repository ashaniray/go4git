### unzlib
Decompressed a zlib compressed data.
```
cat <filename> | unzlib
```

## TODO
- Add file name as arg to **unzlib** (if no arg then read from stdin). Currently it always reads from stdin
- Generate hash of content (optional filename as arg, if no arg then read from stdin)
- Expand tree util
